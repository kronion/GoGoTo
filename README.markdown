###Tab through Google search results
####(Just like the old native experience)

GoGoTo is a tiny Chrome extension (<8KB) that replicates the old Google tab-through-results experience exactly as I remember it. No frills, just easy searching. Keyboard is king.

If you're like me (a die-hard Vimmer), then you abhor the idea of needing to touch your mouse. Google used to be good to us, allowing users to tab through search results and open them with the enter key. Then, without warning, Google yanked the feature. At first, I was distraught. Then I decided to put it back.

GoGoTo is a tiny Chrome extension (<8KB) that replicates the old Google tab-through-results experience exactly as I remember it. With the Google search results page in focus, press tab to move between entries. Press enter to "click" the targeted result. Tabbing past all ten results brings the focus back to the search bar.

No frills, just easy searching. Keyboard is king.
